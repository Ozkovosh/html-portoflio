<h1>The Best Movies According To Santiago</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 moves of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>The Lord of The Rings</h3>
<p>Probably the best story adapted from a book, and with the most fidelity, also even though is a movie from 2001 this
    still relevant today as the money put on production was insane, making them one if not the best medieval fantasy
    movie out there</p>

<h3>Inglourious Basterds</h3>
<p>Quentin Tarantino is one of the best producers in my opinion, and Inglourious Basterds is one of his masterpieces,
    shows the cruelty of the war, and it's not afraid to show how even following the good side, people can be cruel, and
    do horrible things because of a flag</p>

<h3>Pirates of the Caribbean</h3>
<p>Pirates, do I have to say anything else? They are great, they are funny and following a plot line of treason, combat,
    and comedy in a really well written and perfectly executed, at least in the first movie, besides that Jack Sparrow
    it's remember until this day as one of the icons for a good pirate</p>
